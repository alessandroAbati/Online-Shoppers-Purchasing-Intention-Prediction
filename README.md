# Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Prediction

## Introduction
This project is part of the coursework for the module "Introduction to AI" for the MSc in Artificial Intelligence at City, University of London. The objective is to apply various artificial intelligence techniques to predict the purchasing intention of online shoppers using a dataset from Kaggle.

## Problem Domain
The problem domain revolves around e-commerce and understanding customer behaviors online. Specifically, the aim is to predict whether a customer will make a purchase based on their browsing behavior and other attributes.

## Dataset
The dataset utilized is the "Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset" available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imakash3011/online-shoppers-purchasing-intention-dataset). It comprises various features such as session information, bounce rates, exit rates, and page values that potentially influence purchasing decisions.

## Installation and Usage

To run this project, you will need to replicate the Python environment used for the analysis.

If you're using conda, you can create an environment with the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

After setting up the environment, activate it using:
```bash
conda activate myenv  # Replace 'myenv' with the name of your conda environment
```

For pip users, ensure you have the same packages installed by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the analysis, navigate to the notebook directory and open the Jupyter notebook (or any other tool to read .ipynb files):

```bash
jupyter notebook main.ipynb
```

## Results

The results of this analysis, including accuracy of the models, feature importance, and insights into the data, will be discussed within the notebook. For a more detailed explanation of the analysis please refer to the 'report.pdf' file.
